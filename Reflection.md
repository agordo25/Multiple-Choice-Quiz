# Multiple-Choice-Quiz
I first told the user that I was giving them a quiz regarding mathematics by using a string. Then for question one I used a string to ask the user a math problem. I then gave the user four multiple choice answers (all in strings), with one answer being correct. I asked the user to input there answer and then used a condition to evaluate if that answer was correct. This condition was an if and elif statement that expressed whether or not to add a point to the users score. I then printed the user's score in a string and expressed there final score in an int. Lastly, I represented the user's score through a percentage in a string. In the second quiz, I looped the code by putting a while True condition that emphasized that the code would continue while the statement was true. At the end I also added an if and else condition that gave the user the choice to retake the quiz. In the second version of code, I forgot to ask the question to the user if they want to retake the quiz by using input. I also incorrectly set user equal to true instead of y for yes. These changes I made in version three after peer review. Overall, it was challenging to determine myself how to properly give the user a choice to retake the quiz.
